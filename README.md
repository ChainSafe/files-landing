## Development

You will need a Github Personal Access token with `read:package` permissions. This can be obtained [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

- Run `nano ~/.bash_profile`
- Add the following line to the file `export GITHUB_PACKAGES_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"`
- Press `CTRL+X` to exit
-
- If that didnt work and you still get authentication issues, restart your machine
